# What is Tomcat?

Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications from Oracle, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in. In the simplest config Tomcat runs in a single operating system process. The process runs a Java virtual machine (JVM). Every single HTTP request from a browser to Tomcat is processed in the Tomcat process in a separate thread.

# How to use this image.

Run the default Tomcat server (`CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]`):

```console
$ docker run -it --rm tomcat:8.0
```

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:8080` in a browser or, if you need access outside the host, on port 8888:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:8888` or `http://host-ip:8888` in a browser.

The default Tomcat environment in the image for versions 7 and 8 is:

    CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tomcat/temp
    JRE_HOME:        /usr
    CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar

The default Tomcat environment in the image for version 6 is:

    CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tomcat/temp
    JRE_HOME:        /usr
    CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar

The configuration files are available in `/usr/local/tomcat/conf/`. By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required to operate the "/manager/html" web application. If you wish to use this app, you must define such a user in `tomcat-users.xml`.
